* Intro:
   * Time series data is pervasive in various fields
   * Detecting anomaly allows you to find some answer to a particular event
   * Interested in understanding how an unusual peak or cliff is generated  
* Use cases: 
   * Financial Industry
      * Fraud detection (e.g. cc transactions, insurance claims)
   * IoT, IT
      * Failure detection (e.g. machinery, infrastructure, software)
      * Root cause analysis (where did the failure come from?)
   * Generic ML
      * Data cleansing (e.g. remove outliers)
   * There are other use cases, these are the ones the speaker has seen used most often in the field
* Nomenclature:
   * Univariate:
      * 1 metric time series → cpu usage over time
   * Multivariate:
      * Multiple metrics time series → cpu usage, memory, etc
   * Trend:
      * An upward or downward tendency in the data
   * Seasonality
      * Recurring pattern at regular frequencies → Holidays, etc
   * Drift:
      * As opposed to a trend, a drift is a sudden baseline variation
   * Change Point: 
      * Changes between segments
   * Anomaly / Outlier: 
      * Something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected
      * Names differ in industry, can mean the same in academia
         * Anomaly → something went wrong
         * Outlier → something needs to be monitored further
   * Stationary Time Series:
      * Time series does not hold trend or seasonality characteristics
* Value types:
   * Can be numerical or strings (computer logs)










* Anomaly Detection and Forecasting
   * Both: Analyzing known data points
   * Anomaly Detection
      * Data points deviating from what is expected
      * Common Question: What happened that doesn't usually happen?
      * Knowing what is wrong
   * Forecasting
      * Data points deviating from established pattern of data distribution
      * Common Question: If everything continues to happen as expected, what happens in the future?
      * Knowing what is right
* Frequently used Frameworks for Anomaly Detection:
   * SciKit Learn (5 outlier detection algorithms ready to use)
      * Conventions are not standard to industry (-1,1) vs (0,1)
      * -1 being the anomaly, whereas 1 is the anomaly in industry
   * PyOD (module only for anomaly detection, no other ML - specialized)
   * PyCaret (built ontop of PyOD)
      * Most different from the 3 in terms of the syntax
*  Isolation Forest
   * One of the earliest anomaly detection algorithms
   * IForest recursively partitions the sample by randomly selecting an attribute and then randomly selecting a split value for the attribute, between the minimum and maximum values, to create a binary tree
* Frequently used Frameworks for Forecasting:
   * Statistical Methods:
      * Statsmodel
         * ARIMA, SARIMA, Auto ARIMA, …
   * Deep Learning Methods:
      * Pytorch, TensorFlow
         * LSTM, …
   * Decomposable Model
      * Facebook Prophet


* Model Deployment Considerations
   * Streaming
      * CPU/Memory
      * Latency
   * On-demand
      * Latency
   * Batch
      * Efficiency
